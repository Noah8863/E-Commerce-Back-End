  ## Quick Description about the project 

  This project demonstrates a back-end program that uses express, mysql and sequelize to manage a store inventory. It uses GET, PUT, POST and DELETE routes in order to manipulate the database.  

  ## How to install the project 

  To use this project, please 'git clone' the following repository link: 

  https://github.com/Noah8863/E-Commerce-Back-End.git 

  ## How to use this project 

  Open a intergrated terminal in the project and type "node server.js" in order to start up the server. Once running, use a developer tool like insomnia to test all the routes. Since this project doesn't have a front-end this is the only way to use the program.

  ## Main problems faced when working on the project 
 
  The biggest challenges I faced when working on this project was figuring out all the routes and getting async functions to work properly. 

  ## Main take aways from the project 

  I learned how to create routes that weren't initialized on the main js file. Being able to create a route folder and relate to that folder in different parts of the code was hard to grasp but made a lot of since as I worked through the challeneges.   

  ## Tests 

  No tests required for this project.
